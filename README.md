Heat Signature Mapping using the Arduino UNO

=======================

This repository was created by contributors Sidd Singal, Jay Woo, James Jang and Filippos Lymperopoulos for our Final Project in 
the Real World Measurements class, provided at Olin College of Engineering, Spring 2014.

Abstract 

The goal of our Real World Measurements final project was to accurately map the heat signature of a specific test object. 
The circuit implemented was relatively simple, yet the programming and mechanical design were very involving. 
We produced a relatively decent heatmap using the Arduino microcontroller, implementing both Arduino and MATLAB code.
